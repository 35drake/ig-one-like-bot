# ig-one-like-bot
An Instagram automation bot that likes the Nth photo posted by each of your followers.

For example, running this tool can send a "like" to the 1st photo ever posted by each of the people you follow. 

I made this program as a demonstration of Selenium, and so that I can prank my friends on April Fools' Day by liking every person's 1st post (to fool them into thinking I'm insta-stalking).

This program functions on Instagram (desktop version) as of March 2024; if this was a long time ago, program maintenance may not be up-to-date.

Note: This bot is only intended to be used by your own account. Abuse of this software may violate Instagram's Terms of Service.


HOW TO USE----------------------
First, you must manually go to your Instagram profile page and scroll to the bottom. Then, using Inspect Element, you copy all the HTML code for the page, and paste it into the "HTML of follower list" file.
Then, you execute ig-one-like-bot.py .
