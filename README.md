# ig-one-like-bot
An Instagram automation bot that likes the Nth photo posted by each of your followers.

For example, running this tool can send a "like" to the 1st photo ever posted by each of the people you follow. 

The user has two options when running this tool:
- The value of N (i.e., will you be liking the 1st photo, the 2nd photo, or 3rd, or so on)
- Whose photos you will be liking (people you follow, people who follow you, or only people who you follow but also follow you back)

I made this program as a demonstration of Selenium, and so that I can prank my friends on April Fools' Day by liking every person's 1st post (to fool them into thinking I'm insta-stalking).

This program functions on Instagram (desktop version) as of March 2024; if this was a long time ago, program maintenance may not be up-to-date.

Note: This bot is only intended to be used by your own account. Abuse of this software may violate Instagram's Terms of Service.
